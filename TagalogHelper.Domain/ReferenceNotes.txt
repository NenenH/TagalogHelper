SQL Lite Setup
To run this sample from Visual Studio, you must set the working directory 
manually to be the root of the project. If you don't set the working directory, 
the following Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException is thrown: SQLite Error 1: 'no such table: Blogs'.

To set the working directory:

In Solution Explorer, right click the project and then select Properties.
Select the Debug tab in the left pane.
Set Working directory to the project directory.
Save the changes.
